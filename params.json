These partials will be processed using Sass and the available configuration options in Middlemail.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    css\r\n    |-- basics/\r\n    |   |-- buttons.css\r\n    |   |-- headings.css\r\n    |   |-- ...\r\n    |-- components/\r\n    |-- templates/\r\n    |-- utilities/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Formatting**\r\n* Use tabs (4 spaces) for indentation\r\n* Use ID selectors sparingly, if at all\r\n* Use classes over generic element tags when possible\r\n* When using multiple selectors in a rule declaration, give each selector its own line\r\n* When defining multiple properties, give each property its own line\r\n\r\n    __Bad Formatting__\r\n    ```css\r\n    .selector{\r\n            property:value; property:value; }\r\n        .selector, .selector, .selector {\r\n            // ...\r\n        }\r\n        #id {\r\n          // ...\r\n        }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    __Good Formatting__\r\n\r\n    ```css\r\n    .selector {\r\n        property: value;\r\n        property: value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .selector,\r\n    .selector,\r\n    .selector {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Pseudo BEM**\r\n* [BEM](http://getbem.com/) is a CSS methodology and syntax, that helps achieve reusable components. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and consists of:\r\n    * __Block__: Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.\r\n    * __Element__: Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block.\r\n    * __Modifier__: Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior.\r\n* DEG's approach is to follow the general guidelines of BEM and it's syntax, though it is not strictly enforced, which is why it's referred to as Pseudo BEM here and throughout this document. For full documentation on the BEM methodology, reference the [BEM website](http://getbem.com/).\r\n\r\n**Nested Selectors**\r\n* When nesting is needed, it should be kept as shallow as possible. A good code smell is to refactor and break out CSS that requires nesting beyond three levels deep.\r\n\r\n**Breakpoints & Media Queries**\r\n* __Write Desktop First CSS.__ Due to the inherent nature of email development and support, desktop first media queries should be utilized.\r\n __Don’t use device dimensions to determine breakpoints.__ The device landscape is always changing, so today’s values might be moot even just a year down the road. Email is inherently fluid, so it’s our job to develop emails that look and function beautifully on any screen instead of in just a few arbitrary buckets.\r\n\r\n    __Bad__\r\n\r\n    ```css\r\n    .column {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n    @media all and (min-width: 400px) {\r\n        .column {\r\n            display: table-cell;\r\n            width: 50%;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    __Good__\r\n    ```css\r\n    .column {\r\n        display: table-cell;\r\n        width: 50%;\r\n    }\r\n    @media all and (max-width: 400px) {\r\n        .column {\r\n            display: block;\r\n            width: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Device Targeting\r\n[Device Targeting Stuff Here]\r\n* External Stylesheets\r\n* Outlook Conditional Comments\r\n* Rendering Engine Media Queries\r\n\r\n## Frameworks\r\n### Middlemail\r\n[MiddleMail](http://degdigital.github.io/MiddleMail/) is a responsive email framework built with DEG's modern email workflow in mind. Middlemail is built on top of the Ruby based [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator and features:\r\n* Modular Components\r\n* Integrated Sass\r\n* JSON/Yaml Data\r\n* Grunt tasks for automated build processes\r\n* Project Hubs\r\n\r\n### Project Hubs\r\nDEG utilizes the concept of [Project Hubs](https://24ways.org/2013/project-hubs/) as a design & development tool, a prototyping & demo tool, and as an interactive template toolkit deliverable for clients. A basic Project Hub setup is included with Middlemail which you're encouraged to customize based on your specific project needs.\r\n\r\n## Design Patterns & Considerations\r\n\r\n### Modular Design\r\nThe DEG UI Email team encourages the use of modular design for creating design systems and template toolkits. The basic gist of modular design is to break components down into fundamental building blocks that can be duplicated, deleted, or reordered as neccesary on a per send basis.\r\n\r\n### Hybrid, Responsive or Fluid?\r\nThe DEG UI Email team has a variety of techniques that can be utilized when designing and developing an email. However, because each technique has advantages and disadvantages, we do not default to a single one for every project. Because [every case is different](http://labs.actionrocket.co/hybrid-is-the-answer-is-it-the-right-question) we work to define the approach most suitable to a given projects specific needs.\r\n\r\n### Interactive Email\r\nDEG fully imbraces the emergence of interactive email. However, we discourage it's use as solely a new & flashy tactic that only email designers and developers will notice or care about. When utlizing interactive techniques, it's vital that a use case is defined that either works to reduce friction or provide a greater user experience than could be achieved without interactivity.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Design Patterns & Anti-Patterns\r\nAlthough projects do often present unique challenges, there are certain challenges we see repeated across many projects. Because of this, we maintain the [DEG Email Design Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlLqGrOzDMjBXpd7y6pVR4ChXyp3Z8GCn1PtzjoKiuQ/edit) as a set of client facing documentation on best practices for using and implementing common design patterns & anti-patterns.\r\n\r\n### Email Client Support\r\nDEG uses the concept of Graded Email Client Support, which defines the current set of email clients that should receive a verified, usable experience. However, trying to deliver the same \"A-grade\" experience across all tested email clients isn't cost effective and forces you to design and develop for the lowest common denominator. We support a tiered approach to design, development, and testing that will allow us to deliver the best experience possible to each individual user. We encourage each project to define their own tiers that serve their users and stakeholders best.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed explanation and a guide to help determine what email clients to support, view our [Email Client Support Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3vdUmuDUekxD_Lj5rpgvHiLQN_NVI7WuBwG338cq0A/edit) on Google Docs.\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\n### Editors\r\n* Sublime Text\r\n\r\n### CSS\r\n* Sass\r\n\r\n### Task Runners\r\n* Grunt\r\n* Legacy Projects: Rake\r\n\r\n### Visual Editors\r\n* Photoshop\r\n* Illustrator\r\n\r\n### ALM / Version Control\r\n* JIRA\r\n* Kanbanize\r\n* Git\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n* Litmus\r\n\r\n",
